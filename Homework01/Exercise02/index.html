			The flute is a family of classical music instrument in the woodwind group.
			Like all woodwinds, flutes are aerophones, meaning they make sound by
			vibrating a column of air. However, unlike woodwind instruments with
			reeds, a flute is a reedless wind instrument that produces its sound from
			the flow of air across an opening. According to the instrument
			classification of Hornbostelâ€“Sachs, flutes are categorized as edge-blown
			aerophones. A musician who plays the flute is called a flautist or
			flutist.
